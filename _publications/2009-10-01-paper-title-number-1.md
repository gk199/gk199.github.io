excerpt: 'Caltech senior thesis research mentored by Prof Maria Spiropulu, analyzing simulation CMS data for a long lived neutralino dark matter model with two delayed photons and focusing on improving photon ID algorithms with a Boosted Decision Tree. This presents a benchmark study for particle detector precision timing to study its benefit for new physics searches.'
